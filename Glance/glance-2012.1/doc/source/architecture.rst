Glance Architecture
===================

Glance is designed to be as adaptable as possible for various back-end storage
and registry database solutions. There is a main Glance API server
(the ``glance-api`` program) that serves as the communications hub between
various client programs, the registry of image metadata, and the storage
systems that actually contain the virtual machine image data.

From a birdseye perspective, one can visualize the Glance architectural model
like so:

.. graphviz::

  digraph birdseye {
    node [fontsize=10 fontname="Monospace"]
    a [label="Client A"]
    b [label="Client B"]
    c [label="Client C"]
    d [label="Glance API Server"]
    e [label="Registry Server"]
    f [label="Store Adapter"]
    g [label="S3 Store"]
    h [label="Swift Store"]
    i [label="Filesystem Store"]
    j [label="HTTP Store"]
    a -> d [dir=both]
    b -> d [dir=both]
    c -> d [dir=both]
    d -> e [dir=both]
    d -> f [dir=both]
    f -> g [dir=both]
    f -> h [dir=both]
    f -> i [dir=both]
    f -> j [dir=both]

  }

What is a Registry Server?
==========================

A registry server is a service that publishes image metadata for internal
consumption by the Glance API server. The Glance registry server uses a
SQL database for its metdata storage.

What is a Store?
================

A store is a Python class that inherits from ``glance.store.Backend`` and
conforms to that class' API for reading, writing, and deleting virtual
machine image data.

Glance currently ships with stores for S3, Swift, RBD, a simple filesystem store,
and a read-only HTTP(S) store.

Implementors are encouraged to create stores for other backends, including
other distributed storage systems like Sheepdog.
