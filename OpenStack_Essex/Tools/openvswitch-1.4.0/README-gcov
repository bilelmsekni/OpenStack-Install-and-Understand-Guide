Building with gcov support
==========================

The Open vSwitch "configure" script supports the following
code-coverage related options:

  --disable-coverage
  --enable-coverage=no

    Do not build with gcov code coverage support.

    This is the default if no coverage option is passed to
    "configure".

  --enable-coverage
  --enable-coverage=yes

    Build with gcov code coverage support.

    If you enable coverage and you have the "lcov" and "genhtml"
    programs in PATH, then you may run "make check-lcov" to produce a
    directory "tests/coverage.html" in the build directory with an
    analysis of the test suite's coverage.  lcov is available at
    http://ltp.sourceforge.net/coverage/lcov.php
