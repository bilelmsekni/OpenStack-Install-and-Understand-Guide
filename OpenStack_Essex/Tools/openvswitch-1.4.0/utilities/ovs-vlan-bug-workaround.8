.SH DESCRIPTION
.
.PP
Some Linux network drivers support a feature called ``VLAN
acceleration''.  VLAN acceleration is associated with a data structure
called a \fBvlan_group\fR that is, abstractly, a dictionary that maps
from a VLAN ID (in the range 0 to 4095) to a VLAN device, that is, a
Linux network device associated with a particular VLAN,
e.g. \fBeth0.9\fR for VLAN 9 on \fBeth0\fR.
.PP
Some drivers that support VLAN acceleration have bugs that fall
roughly into the categories listed below.  \fBovs\-vlan\-test\fR(8)
can test for these driver bugs.
.IP \(bu
When NICs use VLAN stripping on receive they must pass a pointer to a
\fBvlan_group\fR when reporting the stripped tag to the networking
core.  If no \fBvlan_group\fR is in use then some drivers just drop
the extracted tag.  Drivers are supposed to only enable stripping if a
\fBvlan_group\fR is registered but not all of them do that.
.
.IP \(bu
On receive, some drivers handle priority tagged packets specially and
don't pass the tag onto the network stack at all, so Open vSwitch
never has a chance to see it.
.
.IP \(bu
Some drivers size their receive buffers based on whether a
\fBvlan_group\fR is enabled, meaning that a maximum size packet with a
VLAN tag will not fit if no \fBvlan_group\fR is configured.
.
.IP \(bu
On transmit, some drivers expect that VLAN acceleration will be used
if it is available, which can only be done if a \fBvlan_group\fR is
configured.  In these cases, the driver may fail to parse the packet
and correctly setup checksum offloading or TSO.
.PP
.PP
The correct long term solution is to fix these driver bugs.
.PP
For now, \fBovs\-vlan\-bug\-workaround\fR can enable a special-purpose
workaround for devices with buggy VLAN acceleration.  A kernel patch
must be applied for this workaround to work.
.PP
Use the command \fBovs\-vlan\-bug\-workaround \fInetdev\fR \fBon\fR to
enable the VLAN driver bug workaround for network device \fInetdev\fR.
Use the command \fBovs\-vlan\-bug\-workaround \fInetdev\fR \fBoff\fR to
disable the VLAN driver bug workaround for network device \fInetdev\fR.
.SH "DRIVER DETAILS"
.PP
The following drivers in Linux version
2.6.32.12-0.7.1.xs1.0.0.311.170586 implement VLAN acceleration and are
relevant to Open vSwitch on XenServer.  We have not tested any version
of most of these drivers, so we do not know whether they have a VLAN
problem that needs to be fixed.  The drivers are listed by the name
that they report in, e.g., \fBethtool \-i\fR output; in a few cases
this differs slightly from the name of the module's \fB.ko\fR file:

The following drivers use \fBvlan_group\fR but are irrelevant to Open
vSwitch on XenServer:
