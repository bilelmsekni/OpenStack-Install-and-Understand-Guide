 *
 * Data Structures
 * ===============
 *
 * These functions work primarily with three different kinds of data
 * structures:
 *
 *   - "struct ofproto", which represents an OpenFlow switch.
 *
 *   - "struct ofport", which represents a port within an ofproto.
 *
 *   - "struct rule", which represents an OpenFlow flow within an ofproto.
 *
 * Each of these data structures contains all of the implementation-independent
 * generic state for the respective concept, called the "base" state.  None of
 * them contains any extra space for ofproto implementations to use.  Instead,
 * each implementation is expected to declare its own data structure that
 * contains an instance of the generic data structure plus additional
 * implementation-specific members, called the "derived" state.  The
 * implementation can use casts or (preferably) the CONTAINER_OF macro to
 * obtain access to derived state given only a pointer to the embedded generic
 * data structure.
 *
 *
 * Life Cycle
 * ==========
 *
 * Four stylized functions accompany each of these data structures:
 *
 *            "alloc"       "construct"       "destruct"       "dealloc"
 *            ------------  ----------------  ---------------  --------------
 *   ofproto  ->alloc       ->construct       ->destruct       ->dealloc
 *   ofport   ->port_alloc  ->port_construct  ->port_destruct  ->port_dealloc
 *   rule     ->rule_alloc  ->rule_construct  ->rule_destruct  ->rule_dealloc
 *
 * Any instance of a given data structure goes through the following life
 * cycle:
 *
 *   1. The client calls the "alloc" function to obtain raw memory.  If "alloc"
 *      fails, skip all the other steps.
 *
 *   2. The client initializes all of the data structure's base state.  If this
 *      fails, skip to step 7.
 *
 *   3. The client calls the "construct" function.  The implementation
 *      initializes derived state.  It may refer to the already-initialized
 *      base state.  If "construct" fails, skip to step 6.
 *
 *   4. The data structure is now initialized and in use.
 *
 *   5. When the data structure is no longer needed, the client calls the
 *      "destruct" function.  The implementation uninitializes derived state.
 *      The base state has not been uninitialized yet, so the implementation
 *      may still refer to it.
 *
 *   6. The client uninitializes all of the data structure's base state.
 *
 *   7. The client calls the "dealloc" to free the raw memory.  The
 *      implementation must not refer to base or derived state in the data
 *      structure, because it has already been uninitialized.
 *
 * Each "alloc" function allocates and returns a new instance of the respective
 * data structure.  The "alloc" function is not given any information about the
 * use of the new data structure, so it cannot perform much initialization.
 * Its purpose is just to ensure that the new data structure has enough room
 * for base and derived state.  It may return a null pointer if memory is not
 * available, in which case none of the other functions is called.
 *
 * Each "construct" function initializes derived state in its respective data
 * structure.  When "construct" is called, all of the base state has already
 * been initialized, so the "construct" function may refer to it.  The
 * "construct" function is allowed to fail, in which case the client calls the
 * "dealloc" function (but not the "destruct" function).
 *
 * Each "destruct" function uninitializes and frees derived state in its
 * respective data structure.  When "destruct" is called, the base state has
 * not yet been uninitialized, so the "destruct" function may refer to it.  The
 * "destruct" function is not allowed to fail.
 *
 * Each "dealloc" function frees raw memory that was allocated by the the
 * "alloc" function.  The memory's base and derived members might not have ever
 * been initialized (but if "construct" returned successfully, then it has been
 * "destruct"ed already).  The "dealloc" function is not allowed to fail.
 *
 *
 * Conventions
 * ===========
 *
 * Most of these functions return 0 if they are successful or a positive error
 * code on failure.  Depending on the function, valid error codes are either
 * errno values or OpenFlow error codes constructed with ofp_mkerr().
 *
 * Most of these functions are expected to execute synchronously, that is, to
 * block as necessary to obtain a result.  Thus, these functions may return
 * EAGAIN (or EWOULDBLOCK or EINPROGRESS) only where the function descriptions
 * explicitly say those errors are a possibility.  We may relax this
 * requirement in the future if and when we encounter performance problems. */

     *
     * Construction
     * ============
     *
     * ->construct() should not modify any base members of the ofproto.  The
     * client will initialize the ofproto's 'ports' and 'tables' members after
     * construction is complete.
     *
     * When ->construct() is called, the client does not yet know how many flow
     * tables the datapath supports, so ofproto->n_tables will be 0 and
     * ofproto->tables will be NULL.  ->construct() should store the number of
     * flow tables supported by the datapath (between 1 and 255, inclusive)
     * into '*n_tables'.  After a successful return, the client will initialize
     * the base 'n_tables' member to '*n_tables' and allocate and initialize
     * the base 'tables' member as the specified number of empty flow tables.
     * Each flow table will be initially empty, so ->construct() should delete
     * flows from the underlying datapath, if necessary, rather than populating
     * the tables.
     *
     * Only one ofproto instance needs to be supported for any given datapath.
     * If a datapath is already open as part of one "ofproto", then another
     * attempt to "construct" the same datapath as part of another ofproto is
     * allowed to fail with an error.
     *
     * ->construct() returns 0 if successful, otherwise a positive errno
     * value.
     *
     *
     * Destruction
     * ===========
     *
     * If 'ofproto' has any pending asynchronous operations, ->destruct()
     * must complete all of them by calling ofoperation_complete().
     *
     * ->destruct() must also destroy all remaining rules in the ofproto's
     * tables, by passing each remaining rule to ofproto_rule_destroy().  The
     * client will destroy the flow tables themselves after ->destruct()
     * returns.

     *
     * Asynchronous Operation Support
     * ==============================
     *
     * The life-cycle operations on rules can operate asynchronously, meaning
     * that ->rule_construct() and ->rule_destruct() only need to initiate
     * their respective operations and do not need to wait for them to complete
     * before they return.  ->rule_modify_actions() also operates
     * asynchronously.
     *
     * An ofproto implementation reports the success or failure of an
     * asynchronous operation on a rule using the rule's 'pending' member,
     * which points to a opaque "struct ofoperation" that represents the
     * ongoing opreation.  When the operation completes, the ofproto
     * implementation calls ofoperation_complete(), passing the ofoperation and
     * an error indication.
     *
     * Only the following contexts may call ofoperation_complete():
     *
     *   - The function called to initiate the operation,
     *     e.g. ->rule_construct() or ->rule_destruct().  This is the best
     *     choice if the operation completes quickly.
     *
     *   - The implementation's ->run() function.
     *
     *   - The implementation's ->destruct() function.
     *
     * The ofproto base code updates the flow table optimistically, assuming
     * that the operation will probably succeed:
     *
     *   - ofproto adds or replaces the rule in the flow table before calling
     *     ->rule_construct().
     *
     *   - ofproto updates the rule's actions before calling
     *     ->rule_modify_actions().
     *
     *   - ofproto removes the rule before calling ->rule_destruct().
     *
     * With one exception, when an asynchronous operation completes with an
     * error, ofoperation_complete() backs out the already applied changes:
     *
     *   - If adding or replacing a rule in the flow table fails, ofproto
     *     removes the new rule or restores the original rule.
     *
     *   - If modifying a rule's actions fails, ofproto restores the original
     *     actions.
     *
     *   - Removing a rule is not allowed to fail.  It must always succeed.
     *
     * The ofproto base code serializes operations: if any operation is in
     * progress on a given rule, ofproto postpones initiating any new operation
     * on that rule until the pending operation completes.  Therefore, every
     * operation must eventually complete through a call to
     * ofoperation_complete() to avoid delaying new operations indefinitely
     * (including any OpenFlow request that affects the rule in question, even
     * just to query its statistics).
     *
     *
     * Construction
     * ============
     *
     * When ->rule_construct() is called, the caller has already inserted
     * 'rule' into 'rule->ofproto''s flow table numbered 'rule->table_id'.
     * There are two cases:
     *
     *   - 'rule' is a new rule in its flow table.  In this case,
     *     ofoperation_get_victim(rule) returns NULL.
     *
     *   - 'rule' is replacing an existing rule in its flow table that had the
     *     same matching criteria and priority.  In this case,
     *     ofoperation_get_victim(rule) returns the rule being replaced (the
     *     "victim" rule).
     *
     * ->rule_construct() should set the following in motion:
     *
     *   - Validate that the matching rule in 'rule->cr' is supported by the
     *     datapath.  For example, if the rule's table does not support
     *     registers, then it is an error if 'rule->cr' does not wildcard all
     *     registers.
     *
     *   - Validate that 'rule->actions' and 'rule->n_actions' are well-formed
     *     OpenFlow actions that the datapath can correctly implement.  The
     *     validate_actions() function (in ofp-util.c) can be useful as a model
     *     for action validation, but it accepts all of the OpenFlow actions
     *     that OVS understands.  If your ofproto implementation only
     *     implements a subset of those, then you should implement your own
     *     action validation.
     *
     *   - If the rule is valid, update the datapath flow table, adding the new
     *     rule or replacing the existing one.
     *
     *   - If 'rule' is replacing an existing rule, uninitialize any derived
     *     state for the victim rule, as in step 5 in the "Life Cycle"
     *     described above.
     *
     * (On failure, the ofproto code will roll back the insertion from the flow
     * table, either removing 'rule' or replacing it by the victim rule if
     * there is one.)
     *
     * ->rule_construct() must act in one of the following ways:
     *
     *   - If it succeeds, it must call ofoperation_complete() and return 0.
     *
     *   - If it fails, it must act in one of the following ways:
     *
     *       * Call ofoperation_complete() and return 0.
     *
     *       * Return an OpenFlow error code (as returned by ofp_mkerr()).  (Do
     *         not call ofoperation_complete() in this case.)
     *
     *     Either way, ->rule_destruct() will not be called for 'rule', but
     *     ->rule_dealloc() will be.
     *
     *   - If the operation is only partially complete, then it must return 0.
     *     Later, when the operation is complete, the ->run() or ->destruct()
     *     function must call ofoperation_complete() to report success or
     *     failure.
     *
     * ->rule_construct() should not modify any base members of struct rule.
     *
     *
     * Destruction
     * ===========
     *
     * When ->rule_destruct() is called, the caller has already removed 'rule'
     * from 'rule->ofproto''s flow table.  ->rule_destruct() should set in
     * motion removing 'rule' from the datapath flow table.  If removal
     * completes synchronously, it should call ofoperation_complete().
     * Otherwise, the ->run() or ->destruct() function must later call
     * ofoperation_complete() after the operation completes.
     *
     * Rule destruction must not fail. */

     * should call ofoperation_complete() later, after the operation does
     * complete.
