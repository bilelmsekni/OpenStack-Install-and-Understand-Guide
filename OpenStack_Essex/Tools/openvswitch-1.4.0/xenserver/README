This directory contains files for seamless integration of Open vSwitch on
Citrix XenServer hosts managed by the Citrix management tools.

Files in this directory are licensed on a file-by-file basis.  Please
refer to each file for details.

Most of the files in this directory are installed on a XenServer system
under the same name; underscores are replaced by slashes.  The files are:

    etc_init.d_openvswitch

        Initializes Open vSwitch at boot and shuts it down at shutdown.

    etc_init.d_openvswitch-xapi-update

        Init script to ensure openvswitch-cfg-update is called for the
        current host at boot.

    etc_logrotate.d_openvswitch

        Ensures that logs in /var/log/openvswitch are rotated
        periodically and that appropriate daemons reopen their log
        files at that point.

    etc_profile.d_openvswitch.sh

        Open vSwitch-related shell functions for the administrator's
        convenience.

    etc_xapi.d_plugins_openvswitch-cfg-update

        xapi plugin script to update the cache of configuration items
        in the ovs-vswitchd configuration that are managed in the
        xapi database when integrated with Citrix management tools.

    etc_xensource_scripts_vif

        Open vSwitch-aware replacement for Citrix script of the same name.

    openvswitch-xen.spec

        spec file for building RPMs to install on a XenServer host.

    opt_xensource_libexec_interface-reconfigure
    opt_xensource_libexec_InterfaceReconfigureBridge.py
    opt_xensource_libexec_InterfaceReconfigure.py
    opt_xensource_libexec_InterfaceReconfigureVswitch.py

        Open vSwitch-aware replacements for Citrix script of the same
        names.

    usr_lib_xsconsole_plugins-base_XSFeatureVSwitch.py

        xsconsole plugin to configure the pool-wide configuration keys
        used to control Open vSwitch when integrated with Citrix
        management tools.

    usr_share_openvswitch_scripts_ovs-xapi-sync

        Daemon to monitor the external_ids columns of the Bridge and
        Interface OVSDB tables for changes that require interrogating
        XAPI.

    usr_share_openvswitch_scripts_sysconfig.template

        Template for Open vSwitch's /etc/sysconfig/openvswitch
        configuration file.

Open vSwitch installs a number of xen-bugtool extensions in
/etc/xensource/bugtool to gather additional information useful for
debugging.  The sources for the extensions are in
../utilities/bugtool/plugins:

    kernel-info/openvswitch.xml

        Collect kernel information relevant to Open vSwitch, such as
        slabinfo.

    network-status/openvswitch.xml

        Collect networking information relevant to Open vSwitch.  Runs
        the following scripts, which are described below:

            * ovs-bugtool-cfm-show
            * ovs-bugtool-lcap-show
            * ovs-bugtool-ovsdb-dump
            * ovs-bugtool-tc-class-show

    system-configuration/openvswitch.xml

        Collect system configuration information relevant to Open vSwitch,
        including timezone.

    system-configuration.xml

        Collect system configuration data.  This category is configured
        to collect up to 1Mb of data, take up to 60 seconds to collect
        data, run every time and is hidden from display in XenCenter.

A number of scripts are installed in /usr/share/openvswitch/scripts to
assist Open vSwitch's xen-bugtool extensions.  The sources for the
scripts are located in ../utilities/bugtool:

    ovs-bugtool-cfm-show

        Script to dump detailed CFM information for all enabled interfaces.

    ovs-bugtool-lacp-show

        Script to dump detailed LACP information for all enabled ports.

    ovs-bugtool-ovsdb-dump

        Script to dump contents of Open vSwitch configuration database 
        in comma-separated value format.

    ovs-bugtool-tc-class-show

        Script to dump tc class configuration for all network interfaces.

To install, build the Open vSwitch RPM with a command like this:

        rpmbuild -D "openvswitch_version $full_version" \
                -D "xen_version $XENKERNEL" \
                -D "build_number --with-build-number=$buildnr" \
                -bb openvswitch-xen.spec

Then, "rpm -U" the resulting Open vSwitch package on the XenServer hosts in
question and reboot them.  (The openvswitch-dbg package that is also
produced need not be installed, but it is harmless to do so.)
