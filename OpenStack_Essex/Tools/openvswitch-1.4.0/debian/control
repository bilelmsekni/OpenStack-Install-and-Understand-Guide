Architecture: all
Depends:
 ${misc:Depends}, openvswitch-common (>= ${source:Version}),
 openvswitch-common (<< ${source:Version}.1~)
Description: Open vSwitch public key infrastructure dependency package
 openvswitch-pki provides PKI (public key infrastructure) support for
 Open vSwitch switches and controllers, reducing the risk of
 man-in-the-middle attacks on the Open vSwitch network infrastructure.

Package: openvswitch-controller
Architecture: linux-any
Depends:
 ${shlibs:Depends}, openvswitch-common (= ${binary:Version}),
 openvswitch-pki (= ${source:Version}), ${misc:Depends}
Description: Open vSwitch controller implementation

Package: openvswitch-brcompat
Architecture: linux-any
Depends:
 ${shlibs:Depends}, openvswitch-switch (= ${binary:Version}), ${misc:Depends}
Recommends: bridge-utils
Description: Open vSwitch bridge compatibility support
 openvswitch-brcompat provides a way for applications that use the
 Linux bridge to gradually migrate to Open vSwitch.  Programs that
 ordinarily control the Linux bridge module, such as "brctl", instead
 control the Open vSwitch kernel-based switch.
 .
 Once this package is installed, adding BRCOMPAT=yes in
 /etc/default/openvswitch-switch enables bridge compatibility.
