"""
Methods and interface objects used to interact with external APIs.

API method calls return objects that are in many cases objects with
attributes that are direct maps to the data returned from the API http call.
Unfortunately, these objects are also often constructed dynamically, making
it difficult to know what data is available from the API object.  Because of
this, all API calls should wrap their returned object in one defined here,
using only explicitly defined atributes and/or methods.

In other words, Horizon developers not working on horizon.api
shouldn't need to understand the finer details of APIs for
Keystone/Nova/Glance/Swift et. al.
