README

This docbkx-example folder is provided for those who want to use the maven mojo supplied with the project to build their own documents to PDF and HTML (webhelp) format. It's intended to be a template and model. 

You can edit the src/docbkx/example.xml file using vi, emacs, or another DocBook editor. At Rackspace we use Oxygen. Both Oxygen and XML Mind offer free licenses to those working on open source project documentation.

To build the output, install Apache Maven (https://maven.apache.org/) and then run:

mvn clean generate-sources 

in the directory containing the pom.xml file. 

Feel free to ask questions of the openstack-docs team at https://launchpad.net/~openstack-doc.
