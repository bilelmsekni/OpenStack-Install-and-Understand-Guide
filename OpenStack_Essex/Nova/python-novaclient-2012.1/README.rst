Python bindings to the OpenStack Nova API
==================================================

This is a client for the OpenStack Nova API. There's a Python API (the
``novaclient`` module), and a command-line script (``nova``). Each
implements 100% of the OpenStack Nova API.

[PENDING] `Full documentation is available`__.

__ http://packages.python.org/python-novaclient/

You'll also probably want to read `OpenStack Compute Developer Guide API`__ --
the first bit, at least -- to get an idea of the concepts. Rackspace is doing
the cloud hosting thing a bit differently from Amazon, and if you get the
concepts this library should make more sense.

__ http://docs.openstack.org/api/

The project is hosted on `Launchpad`_, where bugs can be filed. The code is
hosted on `Github`_. Patches must be submitted using `Gerrit`_, *not* Github
pull requests.

This code a fork of `Jacobian's python-cloudservers`__ If you need API support
for the Rackspace API solely or the BSD license, you should use that repository.
python-client is licensed under the Apache License like the rest of OpenStack.

Command-line API
----------------

Installing this package gets you a shell command, ``nova``, that you
can use to interact with any Rackspace compatible API (including OpenStack).

You'll need to provide your OpenStack username and password. You can do this
with the ``--os_username``, ``--os_password`` and  ``--os_tenant_name``
params, but it's easier to just set them as environment variables::

    export OS_USERNAME=openstack
    export OS_PASSWORD=yadayada
    export OS_TENANT_NAME=myproject

You will also need to define the authentication url with ``--os_auth_url``
and the version of the API with ``--version``.  Or set them as an environment
variables as well::

    export OS_AUTH_URL=http://example.com:8774/v1.1/
    export NOVA_VERSION=1.1

If you are using Keystone, you need to set the NOVA_URL to the keystone
endpoint::

    export OS_AUTH_URL=http://example.com:5000/v2.0/

Since Keystone can return multiple regions in the Service Catalog, you
can specify the one you want with ``--os_region_name`` (or
``export OS_REGION_NAME``). It defaults to the first in the list returned.

You'll find complete documentation on the shell by running
``nova help``::

    usage: nova [--debug] [--os_username OS_USERNAME] [--os_password OS_PASSWORD]
                [--os_tenant_name OS_TENANT_NAME] [--os_auth_url OS_AUTH_URL]
                [--os_region_name OS_REGION_NAME] [--service_type SERVICE_TYPE]
                [--service_name SERVICE_NAME] [--endpoint_type ENDPOINT_TYPE]
                [--version VERSION] [--username USERNAME]
                [--region_name REGION_NAME] [--apikey APIKEY]
                [--projectid PROJECTID] [--url URL]

Python API
----------

[PENDING] There's also a `complete Python API`__.

__ http://packages.python.org/python-novaclient/

By way of a quick-start::

    >>> import novaclient
    >>> nt = novaclient.OpenStack(USERNAME, PASSWORD, PROJECT_ID [, AUTH_URL])
    >>> nt.flavors.list()
    [...]
    >>> nt.servers.list()
    [...]
    >>> s = nt.servers.create(image=2, flavor=1, name='myserver')

    ... time passes ...

    >>> s.reboot()

    ... time passes ...

    >>> s.delete()

Quick-start using keystone::

    # use v2.0 auth with http://example.com:5000/v2.0/")
    >>> from novaclient.v1_1 import client
    >>> nt = client.Client(USER, PASS, TENANT, AUTH_URL)
    >>> nt.flavors.list()
    [...]
    >>> nt.servers.list()
    [...]
    >>> nt.keypairs.list()
    [...]

What's new?

[PENDING] See `the release notes <http://packages.python.org/python-novaclient/releases.html>`_.
