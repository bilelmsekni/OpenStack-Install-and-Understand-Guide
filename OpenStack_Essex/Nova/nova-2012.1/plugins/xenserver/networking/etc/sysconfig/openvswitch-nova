# The interfaces that you want to apply base OVS rules to.  If this is
# unspecified then rules are applied to all eth* interfaces, which is a good
# default.
#
# If you are worried about the performance of having rules on interfaces
# that aren't carrying tenant traffic, or you want to do something
# custom, then here you can explicitly choose the interfaces that should have
# rules applied.
#
# Note that if there is an IP address on the bridge in domain 0 (i.e. the
# xenbrX interface) then a rule will be applied that allows traffic to it.
# Make sure that this is what you want.  If you don't want tenant traffic
# to be able to reach domain 0 -- the usual case -- then you should have
# tenant traffic and domain 0 on entirely separate bridges.
