Managing Projects
=================

Projects are isolated resource containers forming the principal organizational structure within Nova.  They consist of a separate vlan, volumes, instances, images, keys, and users.

Although the original ec2 api only supports users, nova adds the concept of projects. A user can specify which project he or she wishes to use by appending `:project_id` to his or her access key.  If no project is specified in the api request, nova will attempt to use a project with the same id as the user.

The api will return NotAuthorized if a normal user attempts to make requests for a project that he or she is not a member of.  Note that admins or users with special admin roles skip this check and can make requests for any project.

To create a project, use the `project create` command of nova-manage. The syntax is nova-manage project create projectname manager_id [description] You must specify a projectname and a manager_id. For example::

  nova-manage project create john_project john "This is a sample project"

You can add and remove users from projects with `project add` and `project remove`::

  nova-manage project add john_project john
  nova-manage project remove john_project john

Project Commands
----------------

.. todo::

   Reformat command line app instructions for ``nova-manage`` using
   ``:command:``, ``:option:``, and ``.. program::``. (bug-947261)

Admins and Project Managers can use the 'nova-manage project' command to manage project resources:

* project add: Adds user to project
    * arguments: project user
* project create: Creates a new project
    * arguments: name project_manager [description]
* project delete: Deletes an existing project
    * arguments: project_id
* project environment: Exports environment variables to an sourcable file
    * arguments: project_id user_id [filename='novarc]
* project list: lists all projects
    * arguments: none
* project remove: Removes user from project
    * arguments: project user
* project scrub: Deletes data associated with project
    * arguments: project
* project zipfile: Exports credentials for project to a zip file
    * arguments: project_id user_id [filename='nova.zip]

Setting Quotas
--------------
Nova utilizes a quota system at the project level to control resource consumption across available hardware resources.  Current quota controls are available to limit the:

* Number of volumes which may be created
* Total size of all volumes within a project as measured in GB
* Number of instances which may be launched
* Number of processor cores which may be allocated
* Publicly accessible IP addresses

Use the following command to set quotas for a project

* project quota: Set or display quotas for project

    * arguments: project_id [key] [value]
