Running Nova
============

This guide describes the basics of running and managing Nova. This site is intended to provide developer documentation. For more administrator's documentation, refer to `docs.openstack.org <http://docs.openstack.org>`_.

Running the Cloud
-----------------

The fastest way to get a test cloud running is by following the directions in the :doc:`../quickstart`.

Nova's cloud works via the interaction of a series of daemon processes that reside persistently on the host machine(s).  Fortunately, the :doc:`../quickstart` process launches sample versions of all these daemons for you. Once you are familiar with basic Nova usage, you can learn more about daemons by reading :doc:`../service.architecture` and :doc:`binaries`.

Administration Utilities
------------------------

There are two main tools that a system administrator will find useful to manage their Nova cloud:

.. toctree::
   :maxdepth: 1

   nova.manage
   euca2ools

The nova-manage command may only be run by users with admin privileges.  Commands for euca2ools can be used by all users, though specific commands may be restricted by Role Based Access Control.  You can read more about creating and managing users in :doc:`managing.users`

User and Resource Management
----------------------------

The nova-manage and euca2ools commands provide the basic interface to perform a broad range of administration functions.  In this section, you can read more about how to accomplish specific administration tasks.  

For background on the core objects referenced in this section, see :doc:`../object.model`

   managing.instances
   managing.instance.types
   managing.images
   managing.networks
   managingsecurity

..   managing.volumes

Deployment
----------

For a starting multi-node architecture, you would start with two nodes - a cloud controller node and a compute node. The cloud controller node contains the nova- services plus the Nova database. The compute node installs all the nova-services but then refers to the database installation, which is hosted by the cloud controller node. Ensure that the nova.conf file is identical on each node. If you find performance issues not related to database reads or writes, but due to the messaging queue backing up, you could add additional messaging services (rabbitmq). For instructions on multi-server installations, refer to `Installing and Configuring OpenStack Compute <http://docs.openstack.org/>`_.
