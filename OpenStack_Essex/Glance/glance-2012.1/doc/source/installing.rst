Installing Glance
=================

Installing from packages
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To install the latest released version of Glance,
follow the following instructions.

Debian, Ubuntu
##############

1. Add the Glance PPA to your sources.lst::

   $> sudo add-apt-repository ppa:glance-core/trunk
   $> sudo apt-get update

2. Install Glance::

   $> sudo apt-get install glance

Red Hat, Fedora
###############

Only RHEL 6, Fedora 15, and newer releases have the necessary
components packaged.
On RHEL 6, enable the EPEL repository.

Install Glance::

   $ su -
   # yum install openstack-glance

Installing from source tarballs
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To install the latest version of Glance from the Launchpad Bazaar repositories,
following the following instructions.

1. Grab the source tarball from `Launchpad <http://launchpad.net/glance/+download>`_

2. Untar the source tarball::

   $> tar -xzf <FILE>

3. Change into the package directory and build/install::

   $> cd glance-<RELEASE>
   $> sudo python setup.py install

Installing from Git
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To install the latest version of Glance from the GitHub Git repositories,
following the following instructions.

Debian, Ubuntu
##############

1. Install Git and build dependencies::

   $> sudo apt-get install git
   $> sudo apt-get build-dep glance

.. note::

   If you want to build the Glance documentation locally, you will also want
   to install the python-sphinx package

2. Clone Glance's trunk branch from GitHub::

   $> git clone git://github.com/openstack/glance
   $> cd glance

3. Install Glance::

   $> sudo python setup.py install

Red Hat, Fedora
###############

On Fedora, most developers and essentially all users install packages.
Instructions below are not commonly used, and even then typically in a
throw-away VM.

Since normal build dependencies are resolved by mechanisms of RPM,
there is no one-line command to install everything needed by
the source repository in git. One common way to discover the dependencies
is to search for *BuildRequires:* in the specfile of openstack-glance
for the appropriate distro.

In case of Fedora 16, for example, do this::

   $ su -
   # yum install git
   # yum install python2-devel python-setuptools python-distutils-extra
   # yum install python-webob python-eventlet python-boto
   # yum install python-virtualenv

Build Glance::

   $ python setup.py build

If any missing modules crop up, install them with yum, then retry the build.

.. note::

   If you want to build the Glance documentation, you will also want
   to install the packages python-sphinx and graphviz, then run
   "python setup.py build_sphinx". Due to required features of
   python-sphinx 1.0 or better, documentation can only be built
   on Fedora 15 or later.

Test the build::

   $ ./run_tests.sh -s

Once Glance is built and tested, install it::

   $ su -
   # python setup.py install
