Welcome to Glance's documentation!
==================================

The Glance project provides services for discovering, registering, and
retrieving virtual machine images. Glance has a RESTful API that allows
querying of VM image metadata as well as retrieval of the actual image.

VM images made available through Glance can be stored in a variety of
locations from simple filesystems to object-storage systems like the
OpenStack Swift project.

Glance, as with all OpenStack projects, is written with the following design
guidelines in mind:

* **Component based architecture**: Quickly add new behaviors
* **Highly available**: Scale to very serious workloads
* **Fault tolerant**: Isolated processes avoid cascading failures
* **Recoverable**: Failures should be easy to diagnose, debug, and rectify
* **Open standards**: Be a reference implementation for a community-driven api

This documentation is generated by the Sphinx toolkit and lives in the source
tree.  Additional documentation on Glance and other components of OpenStack can
be found on the `OpenStack wiki`_.
