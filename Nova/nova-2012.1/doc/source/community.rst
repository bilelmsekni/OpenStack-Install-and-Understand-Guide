Getting Involved
================

The OpenStack community for Nova is a very friendly group and there are places online to join in with the
community. Feel free to ask questions. This document points you to some of the places where you can
communicate with people.

How to Join the OpenStack Community
-----------------------------------

Our community welcomes all people interested in open source cloud computing, and there are no formal
membership requirements. The best way to join the community is to talk with others online or at a meetup
and offer contributions through Launchpad, the wiki, or blogs. We welcome all types of contributions,
from blueprint designs to documentation to testing to deployment scripts.

Contributing Code
-----------------

To contribute code, sign up for a Launchpad account and sign a contributor license agreement,
available on the `OpenStack Wiki`_. Once the CLA is signed you
can contribute code through the Bazaar version control system which is related to your Launchpad
account.  See the :doc:`devref/development.environment` page to get started.

#openstack on Freenode IRC Network
----------------------------------

There is a very active chat channel at `<irc://freenode.net/#openstack>`_.  This
is usually the best place to ask questions and find your way around. IRC stands for Internet Relay
Chat and it is a way to chat online in real time. You can also ask a question and come back to the
log files to read the answer later. Logs for the #openstack IRC channel are stored at
`<http://eavesdrop.openstack.org/irclogs/>`_.

OpenStack Wiki
--------------

The wiki is a living source of knowledge.  It is edited by the community, and
has collections of links and other sources of information. Typically the pages are a good place
to write drafts for specs or documentation, describe a blueprint, or collaborate with others.

* `OpenStack Wiki`_

.. _OpenStack Wiki: http://wiki.openstack.org/


Nova on Github
--------------
Github is a code hosting service that hosts the Nova source code.

* `Github Nova page <http://github.com/openstack/nova>`_

Nova on Launchpad
-----------------

From Launchpad you can report bugs, ask questions, and register blueprints (feature requests).
See :doc:`devref/launchpad` for more details.

* `Launchpad Nova Page <http://launchpad.net/nova>`_

OpenStack Blog
--------------

The OpenStack blog includes a weekly newsletter that aggregates OpenStack news
from around the internet, as well as providing inside information on upcoming
events and posts from OpenStack contributors.

`OpenStack Blog <http://openstack.org/blog>`_

See also: `Planet OpenStack <http://planet.openstack.org/>`_, aggregating blogs
about OpenStack from around the internet into a single feed. If you'd like to contribute to this blog
aggregation with your blog posts, there are instructions for `adding your blog <http://wiki.openstack.org/AddingYourBlog>`_.

Twitter
-------

Because all the cool kids do it: `@openstack <http://twitter.com/openstack>`_. Also follow the
`#openstack <http://search.twitter.com/search?q=%23openstack>`_ tag for relevant tweets.

OpenStack Docs Site
-------------------

The `nova.openstack.org <http://nova.openstack.org>`_ site is geared towards developer documentation,
and the `docs.openstack.org <http://docs.openstack.org>`_  site is intended for cloud administrators
who are standing up and running OpenStack Compute in production. You can contribute to the Docs Site
by using git and Gerrit and contributing to the openstack-manuals project at http://github.com/openstack/openstack-manuals.
