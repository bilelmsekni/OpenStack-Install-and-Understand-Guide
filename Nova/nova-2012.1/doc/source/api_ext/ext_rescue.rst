The Rescue Extension
=================================================================
About this Extension
--------------------
The rescue extension lets you put a server into a "rescue" status when the virtual instance will be replaced with a "rescue" image and have its existing drive attached as a second disk so that a root user can log in and troubleshoot problems with the virtual server.

To put a server into "rescue" state, you do not have to be an administrator. The only requirement is that the base image used to build your instance must still be available.

To obtain current information the extensions available to you, issue an EXTENSION query on the OpenStack system where it is installed, such as http://mycloud.com/v1.1/tenant/extensions.
