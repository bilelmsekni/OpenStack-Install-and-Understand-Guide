The nova-manage command
=======================

Introduction
~~~~~~~~~~~~

The nova-manage command is used to perform many essential functions for
administration and ongoing maintenance of nova, such as user creation,
vpn management, and much more.

The standard pattern for executing a nova-manage command is:
``nova-manage <category> <command> [<args>]``

For example, to obtain a list of all projects:
``nova-manage project list``

Run without arguments to see a list of available command categories:
``nova-manage``

Categories are user, project, role, shell, vpn, and floating. Detailed descriptions are below.

You can also run with a category argument such as user to see a list of all commands in that category:
``nova-manage user``

These sections describe the available categories and arguments for nova-manage.

Nova Db
~~~~~~~

``nova-manage db version``

    Print the current database version.

``nova-manage db sync``

    Sync the database up to the most recent version. This is the standard way to create the db as well.

Nova User

``nova-manage user modify <accesskey> <secretkey> <admin?T/F>``

    Updates the indicated user keys, indicating with T or F if the user is an admin user. Leave any argument blank if you do not want to update it.

Nova Project
~~~~~~~~~~~~

``nova-manage project add <projectname> <username>``

    Add a nova project with the name <projectname> to the database that will be administered by the named user.

``nova-manage project create <projectname> <projectmanager>``

    Create a new nova project with the name <projectname> (you still need to do nova-manage project add <projectname> to add it to the database). The <projectmanager> username is the administrator of the project.

``nova-manage project delete <projectname>``

    Delete a nova project with the name <projectname>.

``nova-manage project environment <projectname> <username>``

    Exports environment variables for the named project to a file named novarc.

``nova-manage project list``

    Outputs a list of all the projects to the screen.

``nova-manage project quota <projectname>``

    Outputs the size and specs of the project's instances including gigabytes, instances, floating IPs, volumes, and cores.

``nova-manage project remove <projectname>``

    Deletes the project with the name <projectname>.

``nova-manage project zipfile <projectname> <username> <directory for credentials>``

    Compresses all related files for a created project into a named zip file such as nova.zip.

Nova Role
~~~~~~~~~

nova-manage role <action> [<argument>]
``nova-manage role add <username> <rolename> <(optional) projectname>``

    Add a user to either a global or project-based role with the indicated <rolename> assigned to the named user. Role names can be one of the following five roles: admin, itsec, projectmanager, netadmin, developer. If you add the project name as the last argument then the role is assigned just for that project, otherwise the user is assigned the named role for all projects.

``nova-manage role has <username> <projectname>``
    Checks the user or project and responds with True if the user has a global role with a particular project.

``nova-manage role remove <username> <rolename>``
    Remove the indicated role from the user.

Concept: Flags
--------------

python-gflags


Concept: Plugins
----------------

* Managers/Drivers: utils.import_object from string flag
* virt/connections: conditional loading from string flag
* db: LazyPluggable via string flag
* auth_manager: utils.import_class based on string flag
* Volumes: moving to pluggable driver instead of manager
* Network: pluggable managers
* Compute: same driver used, but pluggable at connection


Concept: IPC/RPC
----------------

Rabbit is the main messaging queue, used for all communication between Nova components and it also does the remote procedure calls and inter-process communication.


Concept: Fakes
--------------

* auth
* ldap


Concept: Scheduler
------------------

* simple
* random


Concept: Security Groups
------------------------

Security groups


Concept: Certificate Authority
------------------------------

Nova does a small amount of certificate management.  These certificates are used for :ref:`project vpns <cloudpipe>` and decrypting bundled images.


Concept: Images
---------------

* launching
* bundling
