Getting Involved
================

The OpenStack community is a very friendly group and there are places online to
join in with the community. Feel free to ask questions. This document points
you to some of the places where you can communicate with people.

How to Join the Community
=========================

Our community welcomes all people interested in open source cloud computing,
and there are no formal membership requirements. The best way to join the
community is to talk with others online or at a meetup and offer contributions
through Launchpad_, the wiki_, or blogs. We welcome all types of contributions,

from blueprint designs to documentation to testing to deployment scripts.

.. _Launchpad: https://launchpad.net/keystone
.. _wiki: http://wiki.openstack.org/

#openstack on Freenode IRC Network
----------------------------------

There is a very active chat channel at `<irc://freenode.net/#openstack>`_. This
is usually the best place to ask questions and find your way around. IRC stands
for Internet Relay Chat and it is a way to chat online in real time. You can
also ask a question and come back to the log files to read the answer later.
Logs for the #openstack IRC channel are stored at
`<http://eavesdrop.openstack.org/irclogs/>`_.


OpenStack Wiki
--------------

The wiki is a living source of knowledge. It is edited by the community, and
has collections of links and other sources of information. Typically the pages
are a good place to write drafts for specs or documentation, describe a
blueprint, or collaborate with others.
